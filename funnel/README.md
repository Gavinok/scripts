# Simple command queue
This is a simple implementation of a command queuing program written in POSIX sh.

# Usage

I have it opening links in my $BROWSER but I plan on converting it over to use any command.

```
funnel <URL>
```

This will then add the URL to the browser queue


# Requirements

- core utils 
- POSIX complaint sh
